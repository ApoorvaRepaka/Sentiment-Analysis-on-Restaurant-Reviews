# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Restaurant-Reviews

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the text content.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilized publicly available datasets of restaurant reviews.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Included text normalization, tokenization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and evaluated various models for sentiment classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Used accuracy, precision
- **Deployment**: Integrated the best-performing model into a Python application for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`


## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is formatted according to the project's requirements.
2. **Model Training**: Run `train_model.py` to train the sentiment analysis model on your dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using `evaluate_model.py`.
4. **Deployment**: Integrate the model into your application for real-time sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews.
